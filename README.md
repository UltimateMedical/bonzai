# Bonzai
#### Ultimate Medical Academy's theme for the Student Success Center - a component of the Student Portal.

## Getting Started
After installing WordPress and gettting that up and running locally,
```bash
git clone https://github.com/UltimateMedical/bonzai.git
```

Then cd into the bonzai theme directory and run ``npm install``.
